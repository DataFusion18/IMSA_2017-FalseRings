# Purpose: This script will gather all of the tree data we need and put it into a single data frame.
# Authors: Christy Rollinson, Bethany Zumwalde, Jessica Oros
# 
# Workflow:
# 1. Read in tree data & Jessica's Data
# 2. Subset to just the trees Jessica needs
# 3. Read in the tree ring measurements for Jessica's trees
# ------ Maybe split into new script? ------ 
# 4. Calculate diameter for each EW/LW boundary point
# 5. Calculate cumulative area for each landmark (EW/LW boundary point)
# 6. Calculate area of each latewood/earlywood portion (EWA, LWA)

# Libraries needed: dplR, stingr, ggplot2 (for graphing)
